#Floor division, basically Primary Long Devision, will produce integer only

'''Python Processes by (highest to lowest), BEMDFMASA
Thats Brackets -> Exponentiation -> Multiplication -> Division -> Floor Devision -> Modulus -> Addition -> Subtraction -> Assignment
All of the text are read left to right except for exponentiation, where it's right to left'''
#Python allows multiple variable in a single like
add, minus, multiply = x+y, x-y, x*y
print(add,minus,multiply)
